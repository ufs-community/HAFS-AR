# This is a UNIX conf file that overrrides WaterInTheWestC768.conf to run

# This file must be after that one in the run_hafs.py command line.

# This differs from WaterInTheWestL128.conf in that it changes the
# task geometry and number of ranks. That lets the model can run a 120
# hour forecast on Hera in under 8 hours.
