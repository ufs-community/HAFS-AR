# This is a UNIX conf file that overrrides WaterInTheWestC384.conf to run
# with 127 levels. Both the nest and parent have that many levels.
# This file must be after that one in the run_hafs.py command line.
#
# This differs from WaterInTheWestL128.conf in that it reconfigures the
# write component so the model fits on GAEA C5.
